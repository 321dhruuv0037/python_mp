This project aims to use various Python libraries such as plotly, seaborn, NumPy, pandas, and 
matplotlib to visualize student data and analyse their performance. The data used in this project 
will be generated through synthetic data generation techniques, which will allow for a more 
comprehensive analysis of the data.
